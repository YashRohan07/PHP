<!--

$_POST contains an array of variables received via the HTTP POST method.
HTML form submits information via the HTTP POST method if the form's method attribute is set to "POST".
There are two main ways to send variables via the HTTP Post method:
1.HTML forms
2.JavaScript HTTP requests

When a user clicks the submit button,
the form data is sent to a PHP file specified in the action attribute of the <form> tag.
