<!--
HTML form submits information via the HTTP GET method if the form's method attribute is set to "GET"
$_GET contains an array of variables received via the HTTP GET method.

There are two main ways to send variables via the HTTP GET method:

1.Query strings in the URL
2.HTML Forms

<html>
<body>

<form action="09.welcome_get.php" method="GET">
  Name: <input type="text" name="name">
  E-mail: <input type="text" name="email">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

</body>
</html>

<!--
When a user clicks the submit button, the form data is sent to a PHP file specified in the action attribute of the <form> tag.
The form fields are sent to the PHP file, with your input, as query strings:
welcome_get.php?name=John&email=john@example.com
